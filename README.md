This is my first milestone project for my programming boot camp at UNLV!

I decided to go with a much more simpler version of Space Invaders, a game that everyone is familiar with the mechanics and how to play.

I opted to try a ocean theme instead to get a better idea of looking for free images and sources on my own.
All the images are from free sources, the background image is a free sample from a bigger scrolling image.

Ship image link : ? i could not find this image anymore so no link for this one.

The game has a score tracker, a win-loss pop up for the player, a simple 600x600 grid for the game itself.
Ocean Defenders is the name i bestowed upon this project, and it is (for now) only one level! 

I only have one weapon for the one ship and there are 30 sea creatures to defeat.

I used an if statement to keep the creatures from disappearing into the void (outside the grid) and my instructor helped me use that same logic to keep my torpedoes from flying into the void as well! 


I utilized a lot more JS, and used the classes to create the 'objects' and just added a background image for the classes in CSS.
I am still learning, and although there were a ton of examples and tutorials on how to make the game on reddit, google, etc. none of them made much sense to me since there was A LOT of codes and commands i just did not know yet...

The HTML contains the 'results' header, as well as the link for the sono font from googles free fonts.
(I am not sure if the google font should be sourced here as well but it is in my head tag as well as in my CSS file)
